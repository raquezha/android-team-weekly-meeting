## ✅ Completed Tasks

### CI Component - Task 7 (Renovate Automation)

This period I focused heavily on **Task 7**, which is all about setting up automated dependency management using Renovate. Here's what I accomplished:

#### 🎯 Main Features I Built

1. **Automated Dependency Updates**  
   I configured Renovate to automatically check for dependency updates and create merge requests. The best part? It now groups all updates into a single MR instead of spamming us with multiple MRs. This makes reviewing updates much more manageable.

2. **Monthly Validation Pipeline**  
   Set up a monthly pipeline to validate that Renovate is working correctly and catching updates. This ensures our automation stays healthy.

3. **Changelog Generation with AI**  
   Built an end-to-end changelog generation system that can automatically create changelogs from our commits. Added Google Gemini as a third AI provider option (alongside OpenAI and Claude) to beautify the changelogs. Now teams can choose which AI provider works best for them.

#### 🔧 Bug Fixes and Improvements

I spent a lot of time fine-tuning Renovate's behavior:

- **Pinned Kotlin to 2.2.x** to prevent automatic upgrades to 2.3.0+ (stability over bleeding edge)

- **Fixed scheduling issues** - Renovate was being too restrictive. I removed the schedule entirely so it can create MRs anytime, making it more flexible for teams

- **Cleaned up configuration** - Removed deprecated config options, fixed token naming (RENOVATE_BOT_TOKEN → RENOVATE_TOKEN), and removed invalid template variables

#### 🏗️ Code Quality

- **Refactored AI provider architecture** - Implemented clean architecture with provider abstraction so adding new AI providers is easy. Also added silent fallback when AI is disabled

- **Added changelog modes** - Support both technical (for developers) and production (for end users) changelog formats

#### 📚 Documentation

- Added examples for dependency pinning strategies and documented when to use each approach
- Clarified that Pipeline Schedule is REQUIRED for automatic Renovate runs (this was confusing people)
- Updated project guidelines to be more generic and applicable to all Android projects

#### 🔒 Security Improvements

- Added env-protection plugin to OpenCode config to prevent accidentally exposing credentials
- Implemented GitLab CI/CD security best practices across the pipeline

#### 🧪 Testing (22 commits)

I did extensive testing of Renovate configurations - trying different schedules, testing update grouping, validating that dependency updates trigger correctly. Lots of trial and error to get it right!

### Other Work

- **R&D** - Researched various CI/CD automation strategies and dependency management approaches to find the best fit for our team
- **Jira Planning** - Created and documented issues in Jira for upcoming team tasks (honestly, creating these issues takes forever and I'm getting bored with it, but it's necessary for planning)

**Total commits this period**: 78
